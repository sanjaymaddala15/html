	<pre>Last Updated:12 May,2025</pre><hr>
	<p><bold>HTML</bold> stands for <bold>HyperText Markup Language</bold>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.</p>
	<mark><i>How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an .html extension. Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.</i></mark>
